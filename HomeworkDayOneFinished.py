#Task 2: Your Mood Today  Create another if statement evaluating the users mood. Ask the user how they feel today using input(). If they say "happy", print "That's great to hear!", and if they say "sad", print "I hope your day gets better!". Ensure your if statement is properly indented.

if ask == "happy" : 
    print("That's great to hear!")
elif ask == "sad":
    print("I hope your day gets better!")

   
#Task 1: Code Correction Given below are some variable assignments. Your task is to identify the data type of each variable using type() and then use the print() function to print it out:

variable_a = "Hello, World!"
variable_b = 23
variable_c = 3.14
variable_d = True

print(type(variable_a))

print(type(variable_b)) 

print(type(variable_c))

print(type(variable_d))  

#Task 1: Grocery Store Math Calculate the total cost of three items you'd commonly find in a grocery store, given their individual prices. With the variables given below find the total cost of this grocery list.

bread = 2.75
peanut_butter= 4.50
jelly = 3.23
total_cost = bread + peanut_butter + jelly
